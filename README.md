# Carbon UpUp

Carbon UpUp is a self-hosted uploading service that runs simply as a Google AppEngine app. You can use this service to support user
uploaded media (photos and videos) through a simple endpoint.

## Example Usage:
* See [Qosasat Repo](https://github.com/manshar/qosasat) for an example of implementing user uploads in an app (file `carbon-upu.service.ts`).
* See [carbon-up-uploader.js](https://github.com/carbon-tools/carbon/blob/master/src/extensions/uploading/carbon-up-uploader/carbon-up-uploader.js) for [Carbon Editor](https://github.com/carbon-tools/carbon) for another example usage.

Note: This repo is based on the skeleton repo gae-init-upload.
